Description: 
This project allows you to create a user admin that can add other users and give them tasks, check what tasks of their's are done, 
and also allows them to log in and view which tasks are required to be done. 
This application helps someone in a manager position manage tasks being allocated to many employees or team members, and is also useful for
those on the team to mark their progress and see pending tasks.

Installation:
First create a local folder in your device and call it whatever you want to,
this folder will be used to store all the required files for the program.
Next download the files from the repository and move all files into the folder you previously created.
Now the program has been successfully installed on your device.

Usage: (NB!: Python needs to be installed on your device to run this program)
To open the program open the terminal and go to the directory that contains the application.
Go to user.txt on notepad and then type the following username and password if it does not exist: admin; adm1n
the semi-colon is the delimiter so it needs to be there, the word before the semi-colon is the username and the other one is the password.
the default files have some users and passwords already added to view this just open the user.txt file.

Next type the following command:  python task_manager.py

you should be directed to a login screen looking like this:

All the other functions work in a similar way to the add user function and display statistics function and should be easy to use.
